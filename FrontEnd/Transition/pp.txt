Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you well. My name is Ishita Paneru, and I am currently enrolled in the Btech Cse at Graphic Era Hill University, Bhimtal. I am writing to request the disbursement of the education loan for my eighth-semester fees.

I have been a diligent student and have consistently maintained my academic progress. I have enclosed the results of my sixth semester as proof of my ongoing commitment to my studies. I am now in the final semester of my program, and it is crucial for me to settle the outstanding fees to ensure timely completion of my degree.

Details for Eighth Semester Fees:

Fee Amount: 63808
Semester: Eighth Semester
I kindly request you to process the disbursement at the earliest convenience, as the deadline for fee submission is approaching. The timely release of funds will allow me to complete the necessary formalities and continue my education without any interruptions.

Enclosed herewith are the following documents for your reference:

Result sheet of the sixth semester
Fee structure for the eighth semester
Any other relevant documents required by the bank
I am grateful for the financial assistance provided by State Bank of India throughout my academic journey, and I assure you that I am committed to repaying the loan as per the agreed-upon terms.

I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request you to keep me informed about the status of my request. Please let me know if any further documentation or information is needed from my end.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,

Ishita Paneru
